# SFERE
SFERE (Scale-dependent Feedback Recursion) is a mathematical model to explain the self-organization of complex spatial patterns from the recursion of a scale-dependent feedback at multiple nested scales. First applied to the self-organization of branching channel networks in coastal wetlands (van de Vijsel et al. 2023, Nature Communications).
